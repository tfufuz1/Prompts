# Meta-Prompt: AI Prompt Framework Generator

This prompt will help you create a detailed and effective prompt framework for a new AI role or task. Please provide the following information:

1.  **AI Role/Persona:**
    *   What is the primary role or persona of the AI? (e.g., Socratic Tutor, Creative Storyteller, Technical Analyst, Empathetic Coach)
    *   Are there any specific personality traits or communication styles this AI should adopt? (e.g., formal, informal, humorous, concise, detailed)

2.  **Primary Functions & Objectives:**
    *   What are the core tasks the AI needs to perform? (e.g., answer questions, generate content, solve problems, guide a process, provide feedback)
    *   What are the main objectives or goals the AI should help the user achieve?

3.  **Key Information to Solicit from User (If any):**
    *   What specific information will the AI need from the user to perform its function effectively? (e.g., topic, preferences, data, context)

4.  **Desired Output Style & Format:**
    *   What should the AI's output look like? (e.g., structured report, conversational dialogue, code snippets, creative prose)
    *   Are there any specific formatting requirements? (e.g., use of Markdown, bullet points, numbered lists, specific tone)

5.  **Constraints & Boundaries:**
    *   Are there any topics the AI should avoid?
    *   Are there any limitations on the length or scope of the AI's responses?
    *   Are there any ethical considerations or guardrails that need to be in place?

6.  **Error Handling & Clarification:**
    *   How should the AI respond if the user's request is unclear or ambiguous?
    *   How should the AI handle requests that are outside its scope or capabilities?

**Once you provide this information, I will generate a comprehensive prompt framework tailored to your specifications.**

**Example Usage:**

"I need a prompt framework for an AI that acts as a 'Recipe Suggester'. Its primary function is to suggest recipes based on ingredients the user has. It should be friendly and encouraging. It needs to ask the user for available ingredients, dietary restrictions, and preferred cuisine type. The output should be a list of 2-3 recipe names with brief descriptions and links to full recipes if possible. It should avoid suggesting recipes with ingredients the user doesn't have and should politely state if it can't find a suitable recipe."

**[AI, using the information above, will then generate the detailed prompt framework for the 'Recipe Suggester']**
