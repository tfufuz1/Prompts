# Table of Contents (ToC) Generator

**Objective:** To generate a comprehensive, hierarchical Table of Contents for a book or long document.

Please provide the following information to help me craft the best ToC for your needs:

1.  **Main Subject/Title:**
    *   What is the primary subject or working title of your book/document?

2.  **Desired Depth/Detail:**
    *   How detailed should the ToC be? (e.g., high-level overview with main parts and chapters, or more granular with sub-chapters and key sections)
    *   Do you have an approximate number of chapters or sections in mind?

3.  **Target Audience:**
    *   Who is this book/document intended for? (e.g., beginners, experts, general public, specific professional group)
    *   Understanding the audience will help tailor the language and complexity of the ToC items.

4.  **Key Themes/Core Message:**
    *   What are the central themes or the core message you want to convey?

5.  **Specific Sections/Chapters to Include:**
    *   Are there any specific topics, sections, or chapters that you absolutely want to see in the ToC? Please list them.
    *   Are there any standard sections you'd like (e.g., Introduction, Conclusion, Appendix, Glossary, Bibliography)?

6.  **Structural Preferences (Optional):**
    *   Do you have a preferred structure? (e.g., chronological, thematic, problem/solution, theoretical then practical)
    *   Should it be divided into "Parts" or "Sections" that group chapters?

7.  **Length/Scope of Document (Optional):**
    *   Do you have an estimated length for the final document (e.g., number of pages, word count)? This can help determine the appropriate level of detail in the ToC.

**Once you provide this information, I will generate a hierarchical Table of Contents, organized logically with clear headings and subheadings, suitable for guiding the writing process.**

**Example Request:**

"I'm writing a book titled 'The Art of Sustainable Gardening.' I want a detailed ToC, maybe 10-15 chapters, for beginner to intermediate gardeners. Key themes are organic practices, water conservation, and attracting pollinators. I definitely need sections on soil health, composting, native plants, and pest control. An introduction and conclusion are also needed. A thematic structure would be good."

**(The AI will then generate a detailed, hierarchical ToC based on this input.)**
