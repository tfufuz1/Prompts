# AI Prompt Optimizer

This prompt will help you refine and optimize an existing prompt to improve its clarity, effectiveness, and overall performance.

Please provide the following:

1.  **The Existing Prompt:**
    *   Paste the prompt you want to optimize here.

2.  **Context/Goal of the Original Prompt:**
    *   What was the original prompt trying to achieve?
    *   Who is the target user of the prompt?
    *   What is the desired output or outcome?

3.  **Observed Issues (If any):**
    *   Are there any specific problems you've noticed with the current prompt? (e.g., responses are too vague, AI misunderstands the request, output format is inconsistent, AI doesn't follow instructions well).

**Once you provide this information, I will analyze the existing prompt and guide you through potential improvements. I will focus on:**

*   **Clarity and Specificity:** Is the prompt easy to understand? Does it clearly define the task?
*   **Completeness:** Does it provide all necessary information and context for the AI?
*   **Structure and Formatting:** Is the prompt well-organized? Could Markdown or other formatting enhance readability for the AI?
*   **Instructional Integrity:** Are the instructions direct and unambiguous?
*   **Role Definition (if applicable):** Does the prompt clearly define the AI's expected role or persona?
*   **Use of Constraints and Guardrails:** Are limitations and boundaries clearly stated?
*   **Inclusion of Examples (if beneficial):** Would examples help the AI understand the desired output?
*   **Action Verbs:** Are the verbs used strong and indicative of the desired action?
*   **Potential for Misinterpretation:** Are there any phrases or terms that could be ambiguous?

**My analysis will include:**

*   A breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses of the current prompt.
*   Specific, actionable suggestions for improvement, potentially including alternative phrasing or structural changes.
*   An explanation of why these changes are recommended.

**Let's begin! Please provide the existing prompt and its context.**

**Example Interaction:**

**User:**
*   **Existing Prompt:** "Tell me about dogs."
*   **Context/Goal:** "I want a short summary for a 5-year-old child about what dogs are."
*   **Observed Issues:** "The AI gives me very long, complex answers suitable for an adult, not a child."

**[AI will then analyze "Tell me about dogs" based on the context and suggest improvements to make it suitable for a 5-year-old, e.g., by adding role definition, output length constraints, and simplicity requirements.]**
