# Content Condenser/Summarizer

**Objective:** To condense or summarize a given piece of text to a specified length or level of detail.

Please provide the following:

1.  **Original Text:**
    *   Paste the full text you want to summarize or condense here.

2.  **Desired Output Format/Length:**
    *   How concise should the summary be? Please specify one of the following (or describe your own needs):
        *   **Key Bullet Points:** (e.g., 3-5 main takeaways)
        *   **Single Paragraph Summary:** (A brief overview)
        *   **Short Summary:** (e.g., 2-3 paragraphs)
        *   **Executive Summary:** (A more detailed summary, typically for longer documents, highlighting key findings, conclusions, and recommendations if applicable)
        *   **Specific Word/Sentence Count:** (e.g., "around 100 words", "no more than 5 sentences")
        *   **Percentage of Original Length:** (e.g., "condense to about 25% of the original")

3.  **Focus of the Summary (Optional):**
    *   Are there any specific aspects, arguments, or sections of the text that you particularly want the summary to focus on?
    *   Is there a specific question you want the summary to answer from the text?

4.  **Target Audience for the Summary (Optional):**
    *   Who will be reading this summary? (This can influence the language and emphasis).

**Once you provide the text and your requirements, I will generate a summary that captures the essence of the original content at your desired level of detail.**

**Example Request:**

**Original Text:** "[User pastes a 2000-word article about renewable energy trends]"
**Desired Output Format/Length:** "Key Bullet Points (3-5 points)"
**Focus of the Summary:** "Focus on the economic benefits mentioned in the article."

**(The AI will then read the article and provide 3-5 bullet points highlighting the economic benefits of renewable energy trends discussed.)**
